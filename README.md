# Indian-Kids-Screen-Time-Analysis
📊 Indian Kids Screen Time Analysis

This project analyzes screen time patterns among Indian students to understand their daily habits, study-life balance, and potential health impacts. Using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, we process real or survey-based data to reveal trends and insights.

📌 Objectives

Identify average daily screen time among different age groups.

Analyze differences between weekday vs weekend usage.

Compare screen time for educational vs entertainment purposes.

Visualize patterns through graphs and charts.

Provide insights for parents, educators, and policymakers.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains columns like:

Age – Age of the student

Gender – Male / Female / Other

Weekday_Screen_Time – Hours spent on screens during weekdays

Weekend_Screen_Time – Hours spent on screens during weekends

Purpose – Study / Entertainment / Mixed

(Replace with your actual dataset details if different)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python 🐍

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn (optional) – Enhanced visual styling
